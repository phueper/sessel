My attempt to create a couchdb/couchapp based Content Management System using 

- REST (might not need couchdb in the future)
- bootstrap
- angular
- jQuery
- ...


Eclipse Builders Setup:

- install couchdb and couchapp
(see couchapp.org)
- create eclipse environment variables:

couchapp: <path to couchapp bin>
couchdb_url: <url of couchdb to use>
